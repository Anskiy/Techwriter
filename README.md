--ABOUT--

Techwriter is a standalone version of a feature I implemented in Jets of Time. It randomizes the tech list of every character in the game. This means that Lucca, for example, can start with Napalm or Fire and learn Flare as her second spell. This does not alter when you acquire combo techs, or what they use as their base. It is compatible with most mods that don't make significant alterations to the single techs.

--USAGE--

Click the "Clone or download" button to download the program. Windows users can directly run the provided .exe, Mac and Linux users should run techwriter.py with Python 3.0 or above in the sourcefiles folder. Either enter the location of the ROM or drag and drop it into the window. Follow the onscreen instructions afterwards.
